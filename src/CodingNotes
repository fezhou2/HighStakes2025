Color Sorting:
    Program should be aware of what color is in the hook
    Distance and optical sensor
    Use these two sensors along with encoders to control everything
    Set chain to 68 (17 chain links per hook) - be able to track where every hook is using encoder
    1020 degrees

    Use deque (struct called rings)
        which hook got it
        what color
    Use deque to store
    Think about what encoder values ring appears

No PID for arm!!!!

two rings on wall sticks each time

move hooks when im 
- 

StoreRing{} When I hold button R1 and hold R2

R2 By itself is outtake

Hold R1: Intake & Click R2
-Scoring mode

Hold R1
-Storing mode

IF ring is first slot and wall stake and it goes to seocnd slote


reset hook a the top, reminder 

r1 and r2 linked to motors


Thread:


Ring seen = we know its color and its there.
EncoderValue%OneRotation = Remainder 

I find the other hooks remainder by subtracting one hook distance
4 values that pick up a ring
we know currentvalue, which one happens next 
Find value reaches top and we excute another code.
------
Everytime time there is a hook in intaking pos, check if there is a ring, if there is then assign it the hook, otherwise nah.
